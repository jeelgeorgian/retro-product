        <p class="about__info">
          A pager (also known as a beeper or bleeper) is a wireless telecommunications device that
          receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. One-way pagers can only receive
          messages, while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge, reply to and
          originate messages using an internal transmitter.
        </p>
        <p class="about__info">
          Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters
          (or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations), as well
          as a number of pagers carried by mobile users. These systems can range from a restaurant
          system with a single low power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of
          high-power base stations.
        </p>
        <p class="about__info">
          Pagers were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and became widely used by the 1980s. In the
          21st century, the widespread availability of cellphones and smartphones has greatly
          diminished the pager industry. Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency
          services and public safety personnel, because modern pager systems' coverage overlap,
          combined with use of satellite communications, can make paging systems more reliable than
          terrestrial based cellular networks in some cases, including during natural and human-made
          disasters. This resilience has led public safety agencies to adopt pagers over cellular
          and other commercial services for critical messaging.

        <h2 class="about__heading">Operations</h2>
        <p class="about__info">
          Paging systems are operated by commercial carriers, often as a subscription service and
          they are also operated directly by end users as private systems. Commercial carrier
          systems tend to cover a larger geographical area than private systems, while private
          systems tend to cover their limited area more thoroughly and deliver messages faster than
          commercial systems. In all systems, clients send messages to pagers, an activity commonly
          referred to as paging.
        </p>
        <p class="about__info">
          System operators often assign unique phone numbers or email addresses to pagers (and
          pre-defined groups of pagers), enabling clients to page by telephone call, e-mail and SMS.
          Paging systems also support various types of direct connection protocols, which sacrifice
          global addressing and accessibility for a dedicated communications link.
        </p>
        <p class="about__info">
          Automated monitoring and escalation software clients, often used in hospitals, IT
          departments and alarm companies, tend to prefer direct connections because of the
          increased reliability. Small paging systems, such as those used in restaurant and retail
          establishments, often integrate a keyboard and paging system into a single box, reducing
          both cost and complexity.
